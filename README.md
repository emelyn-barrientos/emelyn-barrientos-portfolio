#👋 Kia ora, I’m Emelyn & welcome to my portfolio website!

🔗 www.emelynbarrientos.com

I created this portfolio with the intention of refining the web development skills I learned through Dev Academy Aotearoa as well as having fun with new technologies! 

In particular, I wanted to test out a new React framework with Next.js in combination with Tailwind CSS. I love how seamlessly these two tools work with each other to make a clean, minimalist web app whilst also allowing me flexibility to add a bit of flavour with design.

##TECH USED 👩🏽‍💻
- JavaScript
- Reach.js
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (deployment)

## NEXT STEPS ▶️
- [ ] Add personalised art portrait from local 
- [ ] Refactor code into separate components within Next.js
- [ ] Learn more about Next.js Pages
- [ ] Add separate routes for About Me and potential blog page!
